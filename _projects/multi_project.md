title: Nonlinear Control of a Two-link Planar Manipulator
description: Designed and simulated nonlinear control of a two-link planar manipulator using feedback linearization and linear-quadratic regulator. Further optimization was attempted using Pontryagin's principle and control input parameterization. I plan to revisit this problem and improve my approach as I study optimal control further.
