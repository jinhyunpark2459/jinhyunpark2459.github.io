title: Nonlinear Control of a Two-link Planar Manipulator
description: Designed and simulated nonlinear control of a two-link planar manipulator using feedback linearization and Linear-Quadratic Regulator. Further optimization was attempted using Pontryagin's principle and control parameterization. Still a work in progress.
