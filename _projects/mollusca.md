For my MEng project at Cornell University, I designed a modular software framework for robots intended for microplastic removal from the ocean. <a href="https://jinhyunpark2459.github.io/assets/pdf/MEng_report.pdf">Here</a>. is an in-depth documentation of my project. Also, here is a video of the robot (hardware designed by Prof. Kirstin Petersen and Stephan Wagner @ <a href="https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/">CEI Lab</a>) being controlled wirelessly from a laptop.
