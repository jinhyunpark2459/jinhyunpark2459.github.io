### Problem Setup
In the previous post, I gave a walk-through how we could design a controller for the inverted pendulum using frequency domain techniques. In this post, we will the design of a controller for the same system using state-space methods. Recall the linearized  equations of motion of the inverted pendulum about the upright position:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
M_{c}+M_{R}+I_{mot}\frac{k^2}{R^2} & -\frac{1}{2}M_{R}L \\
-1 & \frac{2}{3}L \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\ddot{x}_{c} \\
\ddot{\theta}
\end{bmatrix}
-
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
g
\end{bmatrix}
\theta
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
f_{c}
$$

where $$x_{c}$$ is the position of the cart, $$\theta$$ is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical axis, $$M_{c}$$ is the mass of the cart, $$M_{R}$$ is the mass of the pendulum rod, $$L$$ is the length of the pendulum rod, and $$I_{rot}$$ is the motor's moment of inertia. The input into the system is $$f_{c}=\alpha_{1}V+\alpha_{2}\dot{x}_{c}$$, where we get to control the voltage supplied to the cartâ€™s motors, $$V$$.

For ease of notation, let us define the following:

$$
H\triangleq\begin{bmatrix}
M_{c}+M_{R}+I_{mot}\frac{k^2}{R^2} & -\frac{1}{2}M_{R}L \\
-1 & \frac{2}{3}L \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Then we can rewrite the linearized equations of motion in state-space representation as the following:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{x}_{c} \\
\dot{\theta} \\
\ddot{x}_{c} \\
\ddot{\theta}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} & H^{-1}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ g \end{bmatrix} & H^{-1}\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_{2} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} & \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{x}_{c} \\
\dot{\theta} \\
x_{c} \\
\theta
\end{bmatrix}
+H^{-1}\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_{1} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}u
$$

This tells us the $$A$$ and $$B$$ matrices:

$$A=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} & H^{-1}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ g \end{bmatrix} & H^{-1}\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_{2} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} & \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$B=
H^{-1}\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_{1} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

We will design two controllers: (1) a SISO (single-input single-output) controller and (2) a SIMO (single-input multiple-output) controller. For controller (1), we have a scalar output $$y=x_{c}-\frac{2}{3}L\theta$$ that lumps together the two measurements $$x_{c}$$ and $$\theta$$. Note that this output is basically the x position of the 1/3 point of the rod from the base. For controller (2), the output is a 2 by 1 vector, $$\begin{bmatrix} x_{c} \\ \theta \end{bmatrix}$$. Consequently, the two controllers will have difference C matrices. For controller (1),

$$
C_{SISO}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\frac{2}{3}L & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

For controller (2),

$$
C_{SIMO}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Controller Design

In both cases (SISO and SIMO system), we do not have access to the full state. That is, we need to implement an observer (i.e. state estimator) to estimate the state based on our measurements $$y$$. The block diagram that implements this looks like the following:

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/inverted_pendulum/blockdiagram1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Or equivalently,

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/inverted_pendulum/blockdiagram2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

This block diagram lets us write the following four equations:

$$
\dot{x}=Ax+Bu
$$

$$
y=Cx
$$

$$
\hat{\dot{x}}=(A-BK-LC)\hat{x}+Ly
$$

$$
u=-K\hat{x}
$$

Substituting the fourth equation into the first equation and substituting the second equation into the third equation gives us:

$$
\dot{x}=Ax-BK\hat{x}
$$

$$
\dot{\hat{x}}=(A-BK-LC)\hat{x}+LCx
$$

Furthermore, let us define the error $$e$$ as $$e=x-\hat{x}$$ and define a new state vector $$q$$:

$$
q=
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
e
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This gives us a new state-space representation:

$$
\dot{q}=
\begin{bmatrix}
A-BK & BK \\
0 & A-LC
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
e
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The eigenvalues of the new $$A$$ matrix is the union of the eigenvalues of $$A-BK$$ and the eigenvalues of $$A-LC$$. To drive the state $$x$$ to zero (or more precisely, the zero vector), we must choose $$K$$ such that the eigenvalues of $$A-BK$$ are in the LHP and to drive the error $$e$$ to zero, we must choose $$L$$ such that the eigenvalues of $$A-LC$$ are in the LHP. The fact that we can design $$K$$ and $$L$$ separately (i.e. design $$K$$ as if full-state is available for feedback) is referred to as the separation principle.

The only thing left to do now is to choose where to place the eigenvalues of $$A-BK$$ and $$A-LC$$. As a guideline for choosing $$K$$ and $$L$$, we were given the following requirements:

1. The closed-loop control system is stable
2. Disturbance rejection settling time $$T^{10\%}_{s} < 2s$$
3. The damping ratio $$\zeta$$ is at least $$1/sqrt{2}$$ in order to avoid oscillatory behavior
4. The eigenvalues of your observer should be around 3 times the real part of the eigenvalues of your
controller
5. $$|\lambda|<80$$ for all eigenvalues

Determining where exactly where should place the eigenvalues was largely by trial-and-error. While placing the eigenvalues farther into the LHP leads to faster convergence for both the state and the error, this can be problematic as it will request too large of a control input from the actuator (i.e. motor). This is in fact what I observed in practice. Initially, for both the SISO and SIMO controllers, I chose all four eigenvalues of $$A-BK$$ to have real parts less than (i.e. more negative than) -20. Even though simulating the system with these eigenvalues satisfied the disturbance rejection settling time, because the real part of the eigenvalues quite large, this led to a lot of side-to-side jittery motion in the cart which made it hard to balance the pendulum. I noticed this and incrementally made the magnitude of the eigenvalues smaller, eventually obtaining a stable closed-loop system with eigenvalues $$\lambda_{1,2}=-7\pm0.5i$$,  $$\lambda_{3}=-6$$, $$\lambda_{4}=-5.9$$ for the SISO controller and $$\lambda_{1}=-10$$, $$\lambda_{2}=-9.5$$, $$\lambda_{3}=-10.5$$, $$\lambda_{4}=-11$$ for the SIMO controller.
