### Overview
In my <a href="https://jinhyunpark2459.github.io/projects/single_pendulum/">previous post</a>, I simulated a single compound pendulum in 3D. In this post, I will be extending this to a double compound pendulum in 3D. I will be using the Lagrange method only. Although the Newton-Euler method will not be explored in this post, it is not conceptually any different than what was done for the single pendulum. The only additional complexity would be that there will be additional reaction forces and moments on the first pendulum.
