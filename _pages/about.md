I'm a senior [mechanical engineering](https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae) student at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). Currently, my passions are robotics and control engineering. This website is a platform to upload my personal projects. So far, this includes dynamics simulations coded using MATLAB and a series of lab write-ups for a robotics course I took at Cornell, where I built a robot car capable of mapping its surroundings and navigating autonomously within it.

**Programming Languages**: Python, MATLAB, C++, ROS
**Software**: SOLIDWORKS, Fusion 360, NSYS Mechanical, SimuLink,
