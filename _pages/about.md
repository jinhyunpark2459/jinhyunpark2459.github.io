I'm a junior [mechanical engineering](https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae) student at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). My current interests are in robotics and control engineering. I will be using this website as a platform to upload projects related to my interests. So far, this includes dynamics simulations created using MATLAB and a [robotics course](https://cei-lab.github.io/FastRobots-2023/) I took at Cornell where I aimed to build a robot capable of autonomous navigation.

Please feel free to contact me at jp2459@cornell.edu for any career opportunities or any other questions!
