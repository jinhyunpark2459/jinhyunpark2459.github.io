ðŸ‘‹ I'm a senior studying [mechanical engineering](https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) with a focus in dynamics & control. This website is a platform where I upload my personal projects! So far, this includes dynamics simulations coded using MATLAB, control of an inverted pendulum, and a series of lab write-ups for a robotics course I took at Cornell, where I built a robot car capable of mapping its surroundings and navigating autonomously within it.

**Programming Languages**: MATLAB, C++, Python, Java
<br><br>
**Skills**: Simulink, Robot Operating System (ROS), SOLIDWORKS, Fusion 360, ANSYS Mechanical
